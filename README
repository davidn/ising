     A 2D Ising Model Simulator
     --------------------------

Quickstart
----------
Build the system with:
./configure && make

Plot some graphs with:
make check

Overview
--------
This simulator consists of two programs: ising - which runs a simulation of the
ising model and runs - which calls ising over a range of temperatures.

ising takes the following options to control the simulation:
 -T 1.2  to set the simulation temperature.
 -H 0.1  to set the external magnetic field.
 -J 1    sets the interaction parameter. This is equivilant to changing T and
         H so is entirely uncessary.
 -s 100  chooses the size of the lattice.
 -t 1000 configures the number of steps to iterate. Without this option ising
         attempts to run until it detects equilibrium has been reached.
 -a 20   changes the number of iterations over which the final state is
         averaged.
 -d .gif makes ising print an animation of the progress.

ising outputs the following fields, separated by space:
1. The temperature of the simulation
2. The final magnetisation
3. The standard deviation of the final magnetisation
4. The final specific energy
5. The error in the final specific energy
6. The variance of the energy of an individual lattice point
7. The number of steps taken.

runs takes the following options to control the simulation:
 -J, -H, -a, -t which are passed onto runs
 -1 1.0  the starting temperature
 -2 10   the ending temperature
 -n 30   the number of temperature steps to take.
 -o .dat to determine the output file.
 -g .png tells runs to plot the energy and magnetisation as a function of
         temperature.
 -f .png tells runs to plot the energy and heat capacity (fluctuation)
 -d .png tells runs to plot the energy and heat capacity (discrete) these
         options will always print to the same file. Use -p to plot separately.
 -S      Don't ignore the sign of magnetisation
 -p      Don't do any calculation, just plot the (existing) date in the output
         file.
 -P      Plot PDF instead of PNG.
 -j 2    Sets concurrency (for use with multi-core computers)

runs outputs the following fields, space separated:
1. The temperature of the run
2. The final magnetisation
3. The standard deviation of the final magnetisation
4. The final specific energy
5. The error in the final specific energy
6. The discrete estimate of the heat capacity
7. The fluctuation estimate of the heat capcity
8. The number of steps taken.

The discrete heat capacity estimate is just the change in energy divided by
the temperature change (note that it is not for exactly the temperature
quoted). The flucatuation estimate is the variance of energy for a single point
divided by T^2.

Units

Quantity      |    Unit
--------------|------------
Energy        |   J
Temperature   |   J/k
Heat Capacity |   k
Magnetization |   Unitless (mag.field per lattice point)

where J is the interaction energy
  and k is the Boltzmann constant
